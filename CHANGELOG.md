## [Unreleased]

_(no unreleased changes)_

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Manual file-level findings** — create manual findings scoped to a whole file (no line anchor) from the files-changed view. Because GitHub's create-review API rejects `subject_type:'file'` in `comments[]`, file-level findings render into the review body via `renderFindingMarkdown` instead of riding along as inline comments. `suggestion` is forbidden on file-level findings at every boundary (zod refine, repo update guard, detail-panel editor). (#34)
- **Manual-finding range selection** — click `+` on the gutter to anchor a finding, shift-click another `+` to extend it into a multi-line range. A compact `PendingSelectionBar` defers the full `AddFindingForm` until the range is confirmed, keeping the diff in view; submit is blocked when the range crosses lines not in the diff. (#31)
- **Per-finding GitHub submission state** — findings included in a successful submission are now durably marked **Submitted / 已提交**, independent of the local `selected` checkbox. `Finding` gains `submittedAt` + `submittedCommentId` (computed at read time via JOIN, no migration); `FindingRow`/`FindingDetailPanel` render a badge deep-linking to the GitHub comment anchor, and `FindingList` groups submitted findings into a default-collapsed section per block. (#35)
- **Collapsible sidebar** — the sidebar can collapse to a 48 px rail that keeps "+ New Review" and a search icon, giving the diff pane ~220 px more room. A running-count badge surfaces active sessions while the list is hidden, `⌘K` expands and focuses search from the collapsed state, and the collapsed state persists per browser via `localStorage`. (#36)
- **Default local/vbranch repo to last-used path** — the local-branch and vbranch tabs now prefill their repo input with the most-recently-used `localRepoPath`, gated behind a per-field `touched` flag so an explicit typed/browsed/cleared choice is never clobbered. (#33)

### Changed

- **Source-neutral home title** — the home title now reads "Review code changes locally" / "在本地评审代码变更" to reflect that reviews cover local branches and GitButler vbranches in addition to GitHub PRs. (#37)

### Fixed

- **Include every commit in local-branch/vbranch source meta** — the local-branch and GitButler-vbranch flows previously passed only the tip commit's subject + body into `{{PR_META}}`, so multi-commit branches lost the intent of earlier commits. A new `readBranchCommits()` helper reads every commit in `base..head` and renders them oldest → newest; single-commit branches keep the legacy single-body render. (#32)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Local-source review** — review sessions can now target local git branches and GitButler virtual branches in addition to GitHub PRs. A new `SessionSource` discriminator routes the prep pipeline through `GithubPrFlow` / `LocalBranchFlow` / `GitButlerVBranchFlow`; the Home page gains three tabs with a unified branch picker, and vbranches are populated via a new `/api/local-source/inspect` route that wraps `but status --json`. Findings export envelope replaces the v1 `pr` field with a discriminated `source` union and bumps `schemaVersion` to `2`. Revspecs are validated (`assertSafeRev`) to block `--` / `-c`-style git option injection. (#26)

### Changed

- **Unified prep + agent activity timeline** — the Transcript drawer is replaced by a single vertical `ActivityTimeline` where every prep phase and the agent review live on the same rail. Node state is conveyed by a colored ring (done / running pulse / dashed in-process / red failed / muted cancelled) and each node shows wall-clock duration; the running node ticks live. Drawer chrome renamed from "transcript" → "activity"; the handle counter now reads `N phases · M lines`. (#30)
- **Husky + lint-staged on commit** — `oxfmt --write` now runs on staged JS/TS/JSON files via a Husky pre-commit hook, so formatting drift no longer reaches review. The hook auto-activates after `pnpm install` through the `prepare: husky` script. (#29)

### Fixed

- **Coverage rows show "pending" while the agent is still running** — files without findings were labelled `Reviewed · no issues` before the agent finished, falsely implying a clean review. `computeReviewCoverage` now takes a `reviewInProgress` flag and assigns a new `pending` status to non-flagged, finding-free rows while the session is `pending` or `running`, rendered with a muted `◌` icon. (#28)
- **Drain the queue before closing the DB on shutdown** — daemon SIGTERM was racing in-flight `start-session` / runner promises against `db.close()`, so still-running prep/run catch handlers could call `sessions.setError()` on a closed sqlite handle and crash the daemon with `TypeError: The database connection is not open`. Shutdown now cancels active agent children first, waits up to 5s for the queue to drain via a new `ConcurrencyQueue.quiesce()` + `RunnerRegistry.cancelAll()`, then closes the DB. (#27)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Review summary tab** — the agent now writes `summary.json` (review overview + manual-review notes) alongside `findings.json`, watched and persisted to a new `pr_sessions` column and broadcast as a `summary-generated` SSE event. A new **Summary** tab on the PR detail page shows a change-stat strip, the agent's overview, a curated "needs human review" list, and a full per-file coverage table; it is placed first and is the default landing tab for a finished review. Stats and coverage render mid-run and the overview degrades gracefully when `summary.json` is absent. (#25)
- **Non-reviewable file filtering** — `engine/diff-filter.ts` drops per-file diff blocks for lockfiles and generated artifacts before the diff is rendered into the review-agent prompt, so reviews don't burn tokens on content that never yields a useful finding. Built-in defaults cover dependency lockfiles plus minified / snapshot / build-output patterns; a new `reviewExcludeGlobs` config key (Settings page glob editor) extends them per project. Filtering applies only to the agent prompt — `diff.cache` stays the raw full diff, so the Files Changed view and submit-time line validation are unaffected — and falls back to the raw diff when every file is excluded. (#24)
- **CLI version display and self-update** — `better-review --version` prints the installed version; `status` reports both the daemon and CLI versions and flags a mismatch; `better-review update` reinstalls the latest published version (auto-detecting npm / pnpm / yarn / bun from the install path, `--pm` override) and restarts the daemon, aborting when run from a source checkout. The daemon records its version in `server.json` and exposes `daemon.version` on `/api/health`; the DaemonStatus popover shows it. (#23)
- **Mark-as-viewed in the Files Changed view** — a per-file "Viewed" checkbox persisted per session to localStorage; the file tree shows a check indicator, a "Hide viewed" filter, and an "N / M viewed" progress counter, and marking a file viewed auto-advances to the next unviewed file. Disabled on read-only historical rounds. (#22)
- Copy-to-clipboard buttons on the daemon status popover's path rows. (#21)
- **Isolated codex `CODEX_HOME`** — the daemon spawns codex with `CODEX_HOME` pointed at `~/.better-review/codex-home/`, so codex's per-directory `trust_level` writes no longer accumulate one block per review in the user's real `~/.codex/config.toml`. The isolated config is seeded from the user's real config (minus `[projects.*]` sections) and resynced when that file's mtime changes. (#19)

### Fixed

- Deleting `~/.codex/config.toml` to revert to defaults now clears the previously-synced isolated copy under `CODEX_HOME`, instead of leaving codex running against the stale snapshot. (#20)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- Built-in prompts could not be located when the package was installed from npm — every review session that didn't have a project- or user-level `review.md` override failed with `builtin prompt asset not found: framework.<lang>.md`. The loader's candidate-path list assumed source layout (`src/server/prompts/` → `<repo>/prompts/`) and missed the dist layout (`dist/server/prompts/` → `dist/prompts/`). Added the dist-aware candidate and a regression test that exercises both layouts.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-16

The shipped 0.1.x line. Feature buckets are grouped by theme rather than by individual commit; see `git log` for fine-grained history. Highlights since the v0.1 initial cut:

### Added — Pluggable agents

- New `ReviewAgent` abstraction under `src/server/engine/agent/`; the runner spawns whichever agent the session pins (`getAgent(kind)`).
- `codex` agent: feeds the prompt via stdin (avoids argv length limits with large diffs), runs under `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check --color never -`.
- `pi` agent: parses `pi --mode json` events, surfaces assistant text + tool calls.
- `claude` agent retained as the original; `claude --output-format stream-json --verbose -p <prompt>`.
- New `defaultAgent` config key (`"codex"` / `"claude"` / `"pi"`); replaces hard-coded `claude`. When the value isn't explicit in `config.json` and the configured CLI is missing, the daemon auto-falls-back to the first installed agent in `AGENT_KINDS` order (codex → claude → pi).
- New `stallMinutes` config key applies to all agents; deprecated alias `claudeStallMinutes` still read with a warn log.
- Health endpoint returns per-agent presence (`agents.codex`, `agents.claude`, `agents.pi`) plus the resolved `defaultAgent`; UI banner only goes red when the _default_ agent is missing.

### Added — Source context

- Sessions now pin an optional **local repo path** (`localRepoPath`). When set, the daemon creates a per-session `git worktree` at the PR head SHA so the agent reads coherent post-merge source instead of only the diff.
- Without a pinned clone, the daemon fetches a partial **snapshot** of diff-touched files via `gh api .../contents` at the PR head SHA. `SourceKind` = `'worktree' | 'snapshot' | 'none'`.
- New `prepareSourceContext` orchestrator, plus `git/worktree.ts` and `git/snapshot.ts`. The daemon also runs an idempotent `git worktree prune` sweep on boot to clean up orphan registry entries from prior crashes.
- Recent-repos heuristic on the home page: pasting a PR URL whose `owner/repo` matches a previously-used local clone auto-fills the field. Native folder picker exposed via `GET /api/fs/pick` where supported.

### Added — Rerun & prior-review feedback

- Every rerun **archives the previous round** (sessions repo flips status to `archived` + findings are flagged `archived=1`) and starts a fresh session for the same PR. The UI renders a `Round N` tag and read-only banner for historical rounds.
- `loadPriorReviewContext` fetches the prior submission's body, inline comments (with replies), and the PR conversation thread; `renderPrompt` injects them into the framework's `{{#PRIOR_REVIEW}}` block so the agent can build on past judgment.
- Force-pushed PRs are detected (last-reviewed SHA no longer in the PR commit graph) and called out explicitly in the prompt via `{{#FORCE_PUSHED}}` / `{{^FORCE_PUSHED}}` switches.
- `extractNewHunks` + `annotateDiffWithIncremental` add `[NEW SINCE LAST REVIEW]` markers on changed regions when prior context is available.
- New `POST /api/sessions/:id/cancel` route. `POST /api/sessions/:id/rerun` accepts `{ agent?, extraPrompt? }` so reruns can switch agent or override the carried-forward extra context.
- Per-review **extra prompt** (`extraPrompt`) — free-form per-session notes injected via the framework's `{{#EXTRA_NOTES}}` block. Persisted on the session; editable on the PR detail page; rerun carries it forward unless overridden (empty string clears).

### Added — Prep visibility

- New three-phase session lifecycle: `pending` (prep — gh fetches, prior-context lookups, source prep) → `running` (agent producing findings) → `ready`.
- `PrepLogger` writes JSONL `prep.log` per session containing `phase` markers and captured `gh` invocations (full stdout/stderr, exit code, duration). Replayed on refresh via `GET /api/sessions/:id/prep-log` (call-tail capped at 200).
- New `RunStrip` component: a one-line live status row between header and tab body. Modes: `prep` / `reviewing` / `review`, each with elapsed timer; auto-hides on terminal statuses.
- New `TranscriptDrawer` (replaces the earlier `Transcript` tab): bottom-anchored drawer toggled with `⌘J` / `Ctrl+J`, persisted open/closed + height. Shows `PrepPhasesPanel` (phase timeline + captured gh calls) above the live `TranscriptStream`.

### Added — Files-changed tab + manual findings

- New PR-detail tab strip `[Findings] [Files changed]`; defaults to Files changed.
- `FilesChangedView` renders a left FileTree + right FileDiffPane; finding cards inline into the diff at the matching hunk.
- `FileTree` is hierarchical and path-compressed (common-prefix directories collapse into one row), with finding counts + severity dots per row and a `Only with findings` filter.
- Manual findings: users can add their own finding directly from the Files tab via `AddFindingForm`. Stored alongside agent findings (`source: 'manual'`), submitted the same way.
- Toast notification when a streaming finding lands in a file the user isn't currently viewing — click to jump. `must` toasts persist.
- Rename-aware path resolution (`buildFileAliasMap` / `canonicalFilePath`) so renamed-file findings normalize to the diff's canonical display path.

### Added — Findings workspace refactor

- The Findings tab now hosts a responsive `FindingsWorkspace`: `[FindingList][FindingDetailPanel]` side-by-side at ≥1280px (resizable), or `FindingList + FindingDetailDrawer` at narrower widths.
- Code blocks in finding bodies are syntax-highlighted via Shiki (`@/lib/shiki` + `lang-from-file`).
- Diff slices in finding cards are trimmed to a window around the anchor line (±N lines) to keep cards readable.

### Added — Local export

- New `ExportPopover` on the PR detail toolbar (`⌘E` / `Ctrl+E`). Scope toggles Selected / All; format toggles Markdown / JSON; supports copy or file download (`findings-pr-<n>-<scope>.<ext>`). Pure client-side, doesn't touch GitHub.
- Shared renderer at `src/shared/export-renderer.ts` so server and CLI consumers could reuse the same Markdown / JSON shape later.

### Added — i18n (UI + prompts)

- React SPA fully localized with `react-i18next`; `en` + `zh-CN` dictionaries under `src/web/i18n/locales/`. Parity is enforced in `tests/web/i18n.test.tsx`. Top-bar `LanguageSwitcher` hot-applies.
- New `language` config key (`'en' | 'zh-CN'`), auto-detected on first run from `LC_ALL` / `LC_MESSAGES` / `LANG` / ICU.
- Built-in prompts are language-paired: `framework.{en,zh-CN}.md` + `builtin-rules.{en,zh-CN}.md`. `prompts/builtin.ts` selects by `config.language`; resolver threads the language through.

### Added — Settings + daemon ergonomics

- New Settings page edits `config.json` in-app (language, default agent, stall minutes, GC days, max concurrent reviews, port). Most keys hot-reload; `port` + `maxConcurrentReviews` are flagged as restart-required.
- Split DaemonStatus into its own popover anchored at the ActivityBar bottom (pid / port / uptime / agent + `gh` paths).
- `better-review restart` CLI subcommand (stops + spawns + re-opens UI).
- Dropped the 4h idle-shutdown timer; the daemon is now resident.
- `pr_sessions` schema gained `localRepoPath`, `sourceKind`, `sourceRefName`, `extraPrompt`, `headSha`, `error`; new `submission_comments` table tracks each posted GitHub comment for dedup and prior-context recovery.
- GC entry point (`gc.ts`) runs on daemon boot to remove per-PR workdirs older than `perPRGCDays`.

### Changed — Workbench UI rebuild

- Visual language reset around the four-column Workbench (ActivityBar / Sidebar / Main / Inspector-as-panel). Cool-slate (hue 240) neutrals, paired light + dark themes, severity expressed as `→ CAPS` text (color secondary), per `DESIGN.md`.
- Sidebar rebuilt: 28px `+ New review` header button, search input (`⌘K`), three status filter chips (Active / Done / Stale) — the only intentional rounded-full shape in the UI.
- ConfirmAction popups are portalled so they escape overflow clipping; they flip above the trigger when below would overflow.

### Changed — Prompt system split into framework + rules

- `prompts/builtin.md` split into `prompts/framework.md` (immutable) and `prompts/builtin-rules.md` (default rules). Framework owns the workflow contract (persona, placeholders, severity rubric, output format, `suggestion` semantics, source/extra-notes/prior-review blocks); rules own the review checklist categories and `category` labels.
- Three-level overrides (`<localRepoPath>/.better-review/review.md` → `~/.better-review/review.md` → builtin) apply to **rules only**. Framework cannot be overridden.
- New `{{RULES}}` placeholder injects user/builtin rules into the framework. Renderer substitutes `{{RULES}}` first, so legacy `review.md` files containing `{{DIFF}}` etc. still produce a runnable prompt (with duplicated diff/path text).
- `GET /api/prompts` response shape changed to `{ framework: { content }, rules: { effective, scopes } }`. Web Prompt Editor adds a read-only **Framework** tab; the **Project** scope is keyed to a local repo (selectable from a recent-repos picker) and the prompts API takes a `repo` path for that scope.
- `category` is a free-form string in the user-facing prompt (schema/DB already permit any string); custom rules can introduce new category labels without touching code.

### Changed — License

- Relicensed from MIT to **GPL-3.0-or-later**.

### Breaking

- `defaultAgent` default changed from `"claude"` to `"codex"` (with auto-fallback to whatever's installed when the value isn't explicit in `config.json`).
- Existing user-authored `~/.better-review/review.md` (or `<localRepoPath>/.better-review/review.md`) is interpreted as **rules**, not a full prompt. Files that contained `{{DIFF}}` / `{{PR_META}}` / `{{FINDINGS_PATH}}` / `{{SCHEMA}}` keep working but produce duplicated content; users should remove those placeholders and keep only their review checklist content.
- `pr_sessions` schema gained several non-null-defaulted columns plus a new `submission_comments` table — migrations apply transparently.

### Notes

- Strict TDD: failing test → implement → green → commit. One task = one Conventional Commits commit.
- UX deviations from spec, all explicitly approved before implementation: edit via pencil + `e` (not double-click); explicit `⌘↵` save (not blur-save); single-column inline-diff layout; v1 edits restricted to severity / title / body / suggestion; light + dark mode following system; passive "submitted" header line.
